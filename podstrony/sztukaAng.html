            <p>During World War II, Germany conducted not only a military one
                invasion of Poland, but also carried out extensive plunder
                cultural heritage. One of the most blatant examples of this
                of barbarism was the theft of thousands of valuable works of art from Poland
                museums, palaces and private collections. This systematic plundering process
                was intended to both deprave the Polish national heritage and
                and the strengthening of Nazi culture. The stolen paintings became a symbol
                not only the destruction of material goods, but also the wounding of the nation
                identity and memory. In this presentation we will look at the history of these treasures,
                as well as their long post-war fate, uncovering a multi-threaded related story
                with their disappearance and attempts to recover them.</p>

            <b>Józef Brandt (1841-1915), "Hunting Departure", late 19th century</b><br>
            <p class="txt">Until World War II, the painting "Hunting Departure" was in the Silesian Museum in Katowice.
                After the German troops entered, the collections were transported to the Landesmuseum in Bytom. During the transport
                many works were plundered or destroyed. At the end of the war, cultural goods from Bytom were located in the surrounding areas
                monasteries and palaces. Their further fate is unknown.</p><br><br>

            <b>Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472-1553), "Madonna and Child, called Głogowska"</b>
            <p class="txt">Until World War II in the collegiate church of Głogów in Lower Silesia
                there was a very valuable painting "Madonna and Child" by Łukasz Cranach the Elder.
                It is most often described as "Madonna Głogowska" and marked with a characteristic one
                for Cranach the sign of the "winged dragon". Figures of the Madonna and Child stripped
                are attributes of holiness, they are presented in natural poses, expressing warmth
                motherhood. Father Heinrich Werner, the last German parish priest in Głogów
                writes: "Lukasz Cranach's Madonna was already taken away in 1943 for safety
                to Henryków, and from there to Lądek Zdrój, where it finally fell into the hands of the Russians in 1945".
                On June 4, 1945, the painting was confiscated by Major Mossew. After 2000, reproduction
                appeared on the website of the State Museum of Art. A.S. Pushkin in Moscow.
                The Polish party has been trying to get the painting back since 2004. There are other paintings in the same Museum
                taken from Poland during the war - "Forest Landscape" by Jan Brueghel the Elder and "Backyard with Poultry" by Daniel Schultz.</p>

            <b>Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472-1553), "The Temptation of Saint Anthony"</b>
            <p>The woodcut by Cranach the Elder resembles the figure of Saint Anthony,
                who, under the influence of the biblical story about the young rich man, sold his
                wealth and settled in the desert to lead an ascetic life. Anthony was supposed to chase away demons
                and evil spirits with a T-shaped cross and a bell. Often in pictures
                he is accompanied by a pig, which, according to legend, he restored his sight. "The Temptation of Saint Anthony"
                 is one of the graphics from Jakub Kabrun's collection. This well-known Gdańsk merchant and collector donated
                 nearly 9,000 drawings and engravings, which became the basis of the Museum's collection
                 Municipal in Gdańsk (later the National Museum). Part of the collection during World War II
                 were transported to Gotha in Lower Saxony, and some were left at the Museum. In both
                  cases were later taken by the Red Army to the Soviet Union.</p>

                <b>Albrecht Dürer "Reclining Lioness"</b>
                <p>
                    Print Room of the University Library in Warsaw,
                    founded in 1818, it is the oldest public collection
                    graphic in Poland. Until 1939 it was also the largest collection. Its framework
                     is the collection of King Stanisław August Poniatowski, purchased
                     from his heirs to the University. During World War II
                     The Print Room lost about 60% of its collection (so far it has been recovered
                     only 10%). Several thousand works confiscated from the Print Room
                     BUW was to enrich the collections of the Reich, including the planned museum in Linz. A symbol
                     The drawing "Reclining Lioness" by Albrecht Dürer became a symbol of war losses of the Print Room of the Warsaw University Library.

                <b>Jacob Jordaens "The Annunciation"</b>
                <p>The Annunciation by Jacob Jordaens was in the collection
                    Municipal Museum of History and Art. J.K. Bartoszewiczów
                    in the boat. After the city was incorporated into the Warthegau, the German management of the museum
                    plundered and devastated works. In 1945, the rest of the collection
                    transported to Saxony, where the boxes stamped "Łódź" were taken over by
                     units of the Red Army and taken deep into Russia.</p>
