                        During World War II, Krakow suffered significant architectural losses.
                          German bombings and fighting in the vicinity of the city caused
                          damage to many historic districts and buildings.<br>
                          <br>
                         The greatest losses affected mainly the Old Town, which was left behind
                         severely damaged by fighting and bombing. Many tenement houses, churches
                         and historic buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged.
                         Among them were such important buildings as the church of St. Andrew, the Church of St.
                         Floriana, St. Mary's Church and many tenement houses on the Main Square.<br><br>

                         The great synagogue on Miodowa Street, which is one of the most important monuments
                         Jewish culture in Krakow was also completely destroyed as a result of the war.<br><br>

                         Many cultural and scientific institutions in Krakow also suffered in
                         during the war. The Jagiellonian Library, one of the oldest and most important
                         libraries in Poland, lost large collections as a result of fires and as a result of warfare.
                         The Jagiellonian University also suffered significant damage, and many of its buildings remained
                         damaged.

                        As a result of hostilities, bombings and street fights, many historic buildings and monuments in
                         Lublin were destroyed or seriously damaged. The Old Town, which was one of the oldest
                         and the most beautiful areas of the city, suffered in a special way. Many tenement houses, churches, synagogues
                         and other historic buildings were destroyed or severely damaged.<br><br>

                         An example of losses in Lublin is the Lublin Castle, which was seriously damaged as a result of bombing
                          and fights. Many other important buildings, such as the Lublin Cathedral, St. Michael the Archangel,
                          st. John the Baptist, as well as the synagogues suffered losses.<br><br>

                         In addition, there was also a German concentration camp near Lublin
                         Majdanek, which was established in 1941. This camp was a place of martyrdom and death for
                         thousands of prisoners, mostly Jews, and a place where criminal experiments were carried out
                         medical. After the war, the camp became a memorial site and a museum commemorating the victims of the Holocaust.<br><br>

                         After the end of the war, Lublin undertook efforts to rebuild and reconstruct the destroyed buildings
                         and monuments. Some of them were recreated according to the original plans, while others
                         have been replaced by a new architecture. Currently, Lublin still has many historical buildings,
                         which remind of its rich past, while combining with modernity and development
                         as a dynamic city.<br><br>

                        During World War II, Łódź also suffered significant architectural losses.
                        The city was a strategic target for the Germans because of its industrial importance
                        and a large Jewish population, which contributed to the intensification of hostilities and destruction.<br><br>

                        As a result of bombing, mainly in the period from 1944 to 1945, many
                        districts of Łódź were destroyed. Many tenement houses, factories and other buildings were destroyed
                        or has been seriously damaged. Many historic architectural buildings, such as palaces,
                        tenement houses and churches also suffered.<br><br>

                        After the end of the war, Łódź, like other cities in Poland, began the reconstruction process.
                        Some of the destroyed buildings have been recreated, but many have also been replaced
                        new architecture. Currently, in Lodz you can see both rebuilt monuments and modern ones
                         buildings, creating a unique combination of past and present.

                         such as Królikarnia or palaces in the Royal Łazienki Park, have been reconstructed in accordance
                         with original plans, while other objects have been replaced with modern architecture.<br><br>
